# heimdall (Working title)

## Description:
The goal of this project is to create a centeralized way to manage Containers and VMs across multiple hosts free of clustering constraints. 

## NOTICE:
The current HTML, JS, and CSS is from https://github.com/taniarascia/sandbox/tree/master/ghibli with some modifications to the JS and CSS to better reflect the row like cards we are aiming for in a working version.
